					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>The very first step to getting a degree in computer science is to take courses for it.
						But what courses do you need to take? Well here, we will discuss the courses that you are required
						to take in order to graduate with a CS Degree and as well the skills needed to pass job interviews.
					</p>

					<p>During freshman year, you should take Intro CS courses to see whether Computer Science is the path for you or not.
						These Intro to coding classes are elementary classes where you would scratch the surface of coding to get a feel of how it would be like.
						You would get familiar with, and touch upon simple concepts like variables, methods and basic computational math.
						There is no pre-requisite required for these courses, however it might be best to know at least up to highschool math. This could make
						coding easier for you, because coding requires knowing how to apply various different algorithms and to undestand them, you would need to know
						math. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Note: You do not need to follow the courses you need to take, down to every exact detail.
						This is a simple guideline you can follow if you are lost and it's okay if the final
						classes you take may look different. You can take more advance classes during your 
						freshman year or even take easier classes during your later years while just taking 
						electives early on. For more information, you can refer to the BC Roadmap link I provided in the coffee cup.
					</p>

					<h3>Courses to take Freshman Year</h3>

						<li>MATH 1011 Precalculus Mathematics (Pre-requisite to take Calc 1)</li>
						<li>CISC 1115 or CISC 1170 Introduction to Programming Using Java</li>
						<li>ENGL 1010 English Composition I(First Semester, then following into ENGL 1012) </li>
						<li>ENGL 1012 English Composition II (A required core class required to graduate and also a pre-requisite for ethics class)</li>
						<li>the rest you may take electives or core elective classes to graduate. (See BC Roadmap)</li>
