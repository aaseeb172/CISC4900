					<h2>Courses (Senior Year)</h2>
				

					<p>	This is your final year. There is a lot of things you will learn,
						and after graduating you will start applying them to your work while honing your skills.
						During your senior year, you will learn complex core theory(Algorithms) which will allow you to optimize your
						code so they can run the most efficiently. After all, a job is a business, therefore, this is very 
						important to getting hired since time is money. 
					   </p>

					<h3>Courses to take Senior Year</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>MATH 2501 Elementary Probability and Statistics</li>
						<li>CISC 3220 Analysis of Algorithms/CISC 3230 Computer Theory </li>
						<li>CISC 3320 Operating Systems </li>
						<li>CISC 3142 Programming Paradigms in C++</li>
						<li>CISC 3140 Design and Implementation of Large-Scale Web Applications</li>
						<li>3 Advanced CISC course numbered between 3000 and 4899</li>
						<li>the rest you may take electives or core elective classes to graduate. (See BC Roadmap)</li>
					</ul>
					

					<p>You may also learn computer theory during your senior year, but since 
						you only need Algorithms or Computer Theory, I recommend that you must take Algorithms 
						if you were to choose 1 of the 2 because it is very
						important when you are trying to optimize code. However if you could take both, you should since they are both useful.
						 In Computer Theory, you may not be doing any coding and strictly only theory but the theory you learn
						 will be applicable to your code. It will let you see code in ways you didn't before which 
						 can be benefical to you in the long term.
					</p>

					<p>Another thing you may do during your senior year in computer science is maybe learning new languages.
						An examples is in Web Apps, you will learn html, css, and javascripts(front-end).
						While in Programming Paradigms in C++, you will learn to program in C++ while also paradigms specific to that language.
						However some ideas are applicable to all programming languages.
